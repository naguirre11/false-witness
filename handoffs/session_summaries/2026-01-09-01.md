## Summary

Implemented the Verification Rules Engine (FW-036a), the core trust-level verification system for the evidence cross-verification feature. Created a separate VerificationManager autoload that validates evidence verification attempts based on trust levels (UNFALSIFIABLE, HIGH, VARIABLE, LOW, SABOTAGE_RISK).

## Changes Made

- `src/evidence/verification_manager.gd`: New VerificationManager autoload with trust-level verification rules
- `src/evidence/evidence.gd`: Added witness tracking fields (witness_ids, verifier_id, setup_witness_id, result_witness_id, sabotage_flags, verification_metadata)
- `src/evidence/evidence_manager.gd`: Integrated VerificationManager for verify/contest validation
- `project.godot`: Added VerificationManager autoload
- `tests/test_verification_manager.gd`: 38 unit tests for all verification rules
- `tickets/draft/FW-036a-verification-rules.md`: Created sub-ticket from FW-036
- `tickets/draft/FW-036b-behavioral-conflict.md`: Created sub-ticket for gotcha system
- `tickets/draft/FW-036c-verification-timing.md`: Created sub-ticket for staleness
- `tickets/ready/FW-036-cross-verification.md`: Updated to epic with sub-tickets

## Current State

**VerificationManager** is fully operational with:
- Trust-level-specific verification rules
- Witness tracking for UNFALSIFIABLE evidence
- Operator history for LOW trust evidence
- Buddy system support for SABOTAGE_RISK evidence
- Sabotage flag detection
- All signals properly emitting

**Test Results**: 749/749 tests passing including 38 new verification manager tests.

## Next Steps

1. **FW-037 (Spectral Prism Rig)** - Next ticket in queue
2. **FW-036b (Behavioral Conflict)** - Gotcha system (in draft, needs FW-041 entity system)
3. **FW-036c (Verification Timing)** - Evidence staleness (in draft)

## Architecture Notes

Chose separate VerificationManager autoload over extending EvidenceManager:
- Clean separation of concerns
- EvidenceManager handles collection/storage
- VerificationManager handles trust-level rule validation
- EvidenceManager delegates to VerificationManager for verify/contest operations

## Open Questions

None - implementation complete as specified.
