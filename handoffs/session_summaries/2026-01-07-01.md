## Summary

Completed FW-001 (Godot project initialization) and made the template decision for networking architecture. Integrated GodotSteam Template as the base for Steam P2P multiplayer.

## Changes Made

### FW-001: Project Initialization
- `project.godot`: Created with 3D config, Forward Plus renderer, 1920x1080, physics layers, input actions
- `src/`, `assets/`, `scenes/`, `tests/`, `addons/`: Full folder structure with .gdkeep files
- `.gitignore`: Godot-specific ignores
- `addons/gut/`: GUT v9.3.0 testing framework installed
- `tests/test_example.gd`: Example test file
- `.gutconfig.json`: GUT configuration

### Template Decision & Integration
- `CLAUDE.md`: Documented template decision (GodotSteam base + custom systems)
- `addons/godotsteam/`: GodotSteam GDExtension (Win/Linux/macOS binaries)
- `src/core/steam_manager.gd`: Steam initialization autoload
- `src/core/network_manager.gd`: Lobby & P2P networking autoload

### Documentation
- `docs/False_Witness_GDD.md`: Exported from .docx for easy reading
- `docs/False_Witness_Design_Supplement.md`: Exported from .docx

## Current State

- Project compiles successfully in Godot 4.4.1
- GodotSteam addon integrated with autoloads registered
- FW-001 in `tickets/for_review/`
- PRIORITIZATION.md updated: NEXT is FW-002

### Networking Architecture Decided:
- **Transport**: Steam P2P via GodotSteam
- **Topology**: Host-based (one player hosts, others join via Steam lobby)
- **Reference patterns**: Cogito for interaction/inventory (not used directly due to single-player focus)

## Next Steps

1. **Review FW-001** - Move to completed/ if approved
2. **FW-002: Core autoload architecture** - Now unblocked, defines GameManager, EventBus, etc.
3. **FW-011: Networking foundation** - Will build on the GodotSteam integration done today

## Open Questions / Decisions Needed

None - template decision made (Option 1: GodotSteam base + custom systems)
