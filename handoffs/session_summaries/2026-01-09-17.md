## Summary

Implemented the Aura Equipment Base (FW-038a), establishing the foundation for the Dowsing Rods + Aura Imager cooperative equipment pair. Created aura data structures (colors, forms, temperaments) and spatial constraint validation system for the asymmetric trust dynamic.

## Changes Made

- `src/equipment/aura/aura_enums.gd`: AuraEnums class with:
  - AuraColor enum (COLD_BLUE, HOT_RED, PALE_GREEN, DEEP_PURPLE)
  - AuraForm enum (TIGHT_CONTAINED, SPIKING_ERRATIC, DIFFUSE_SPREADING, SWIRLING_MOBILE)
  - EntityTemperament enum (PASSIVE, AGGRESSIVE, TERRITORIAL, ROAMING)
  - Bidirectional mappings and consistency checking
  - Combined signature display for evidence

- `src/equipment/aura/spatial_constraints.gd`: SpatialConstraints class with:
  - ConstraintConfig for configurable tolerances (30° facing, 60° behind, 1-5m distance)
  - ConstraintResult for validation results with violations list
  - AlignmentQuality enum (NONE, WEAK, MODERATE, STRONG)
  - Position validation methods for Dowser-Imager-Anchor triangle
  - Quality calculation (0.0-1.0 score)

- `tests/test_aura_enums.gd`: 52 comprehensive tests
- `tests/test_spatial_constraints.gd`: 45 comprehensive tests

- Created sub-tickets FW-038b (Dowsing Rods) and FW-038c (Aura Imager) following the same pattern as FW-037's breakdown

## Current State

FW-038a is complete and moved to for_review. All tests pass (full suite: all tests passed). The aura equipment base provides:

1. **Aura data structures** - Colors and forms map to entity temperament, enabling consistency checking (color temperament should match form behavior)

2. **Spatial constraints** - Validates the physical positioning required for the asymmetric trust dynamic:
   - Dowser must face anchor point (visible to all)
   - Imager must be behind Dowser (only they see the screen)

## Next Steps

1. **FW-038b: Dowsing Rods Unit** (marked as NEXT)
   - Rod state machine (IDLE, HELD, SEEKING, ALIGNED)
   - Physical response to anchor proximity
   - Alignment detection and quality
   - Observable state (anti-deception - rod positions visible to all)

2. **FW-038c: Aura Imager Unit**
   - Spatial positioning behind Dowser
   - Aura visualization (resolves with alignment quality)
   - Evidence collection
   - Third-party observation mechanics

## Open Questions / Decisions Needed

None - the design is clear from the FW-038 epic ticket and follows the established patterns from the Spectral Prism equipment (FW-037).
