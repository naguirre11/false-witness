## Summary

Implemented trust level visualization for the evidence board (FW-035b). Each evidence slot now displays a colored border indicating its trust level, tooltips explaining trust implications on hover, and visual weight differences between strong and weak readings.

## Changes Made

- `src/ui/evidence_slot.gd`: Added `TRUST_COLORS` and `TRUST_TOOLTIPS` constants, `_setup_trust_styling()` function, updated `_update_icon()` for quality-based alpha, fixed `set_collected()` to update icon
- `scenes/ui/evidence_slot.tscn`: Added Border panel node for trust level styling
- `tests/test_evidence_slot.gd`: Added 11 new tests for trust visualization (25 total tests in file)
- `tickets/STATUS.md`: Updated NEXT pointer to FW-035c

## Current State

- FW-035b completed and moved to `for_review`
- All 691 tests passing
- Evidence board now shows trust levels visually:
  - Gold border: UNFALSIFIABLE (Hunt Behavior)
  - Green border: HIGH (EMF, Thermometer, Visual, Physical)
  - Yellow border: VARIABLE (Aura Pattern)
  - Orange border: LOW (Prism Reading)
  - Red border: SABOTAGE_RISK (Ghost Writing)
- Tooltips show `[Trust Name] Explanation` on hover
- Strong readings: full alpha icon, Weak readings: 0.6 alpha

## Next Steps

1. FW-035c: Collector Attribution & Verification - Show who collected each piece of evidence
2. FW-035d: Entity Possibility Matrix - Show which entities are possible based on collected evidence

## Open Questions / Decisions Needed

None - implementation matches ticket requirements exactly.
