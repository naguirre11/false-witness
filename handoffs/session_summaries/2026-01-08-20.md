## Summary

Split FW-035 (Evidence Board UI) into 4 sub-tickets for better manageability, then implemented FW-035a (Evidence Board Core UI). Created the fundamental evidence board panel that displays all 8 evidence types organized by category with hotkey toggle and deliberation phase visibility.

## Changes Made

- `src/ui/evidence_board.gd`: Main evidence board panel with category organization
- `src/ui/evidence_slot.gd`: Individual evidence slot component
- `scenes/ui/evidence_board.tscn`: Evidence board scene
- `scenes/ui/evidence_slot.tscn`: Evidence slot scene
- `tests/test_evidence_board.gd`: 20 tests for EvidenceBoard
- `tests/test_evidence_slot.gd`: 14 tests for EvidenceSlot
- `project.godot`: Added `toggle_evidence_board` input action (Tab key)
- `gdlintrc`: Created with default lint config, raised max-public-methods to 50
- `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`: Updated with new UI files
- `tickets/STATUS.md`: Updated with sub-tickets and NEXT pointer
- `tickets/draft/FW-035b-trust-visualization.md`: Trust level visualization ticket
- `tickets/draft/FW-035c-collector-attribution.md`: Collector attribution ticket
- `tickets/draft/FW-035d-entity-matrix.md`: Entity possibility matrix ticket

## Current State

- FW-035a completed and in `for_review`
- All 680 tests passing (34 new tests for evidence board)
- Evidence board displays all 8 evidence types in 4 categories
- Hotkey (Tab) toggles visibility during investigation
- Forced visible during DELIBERATION phase
- Integrates with EvidenceManager signals

## Next Steps

1. Pick up FW-035b (Trust Level Visualization) - add trust indicators and quality display
2. Or continue with FW-035c (Collector Attribution) - show who collected each evidence
3. FW-035d (Entity Matrix) blocked by FW-041 (Entity Core)

## Open Questions / Decisions Needed

None - straightforward implementation based on existing evidence system patterns.

## Architecture Notes

The evidence board dynamically builds category rows from `EVIDENCE_BY_CATEGORY` constant mapping. Each slot is an instance of EvidenceSlot that connects to the EvidenceManager for collection status updates.
