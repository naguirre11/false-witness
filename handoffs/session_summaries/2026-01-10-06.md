## Summary

Aligned entity tickets with the implemented evidence system. The GDD used Phasmophobia-style evidence names (Spirit Box, DOTS, Ghost Orbs, etc.) but the codebase implements a different 8-evidence system focused on cooperative equipment and trust dynamics. Created new entity-evidence matrix and updated all affected tickets.

## Changes Made

### Tickets Updated

| Ticket | Changes |
|--------|---------|
| `FW-044-first-entity-phantom.md` | Evidence: EMF_SIGNATURE, PRISM_READING, VISUAL_MANIFESTATION |
| `FW-046-listener-entity.md` | Evidence: FREEZING_TEMPERATURE, GHOST_WRITING, AURA_PATTERN |
| `FW-052-cultist-abilities.md` | Updated contamination abilities (Prism Interference, Aura Disruption) |
| `FW-023-equipment-system.md` | Updated equipment list in technical notes |
| `FW-082-equipment-select-ui.md` | Updated equipment list |
| `FW-042b-detection-mechanics.md` | Updated electronics list |
| `PRIORITIZATION_ROADMAP.md` | Added full entity-evidence matrix (10 entities) |
| `STATUS.md` | Added FW-103 |

### New Ticket Created

- `tickets/draft/FW-103-equipment-constants-cleanup.md` - Clean up stale equipment type constants in code (`equipment_slot.gd`, `hunt_detection.gd`)

## Implemented Evidence System (8 types)

| Evidence Type | Equipment | Category |
|---------------|-----------|----------|
| EMF_SIGNATURE | EMF Reader | Equipment-Derived |
| FREEZING_TEMPERATURE | Thermometer | Equipment-Derived |
| PRISM_READING | Spectral Prism (cooperative) | Equipment-Derived |
| AURA_PATTERN | Dowsing Rods + Aura Imager (cooperative) | Equipment-Derived |
| GHOST_WRITING | Ghost Writing Book | Triggered Test |
| VISUAL_MANIFESTATION | Direct observation | Readily Apparent |
| PHYSICAL_INTERACTION | Thrown objects, doors | Readily Apparent |
| HUNT_BEHAVIOR | Entity patterns | Behavior-Based |

**NOT Implemented**: Spirit Box (deferred FW-034), DOTS, Ghost Orbs, UV/Fingerprints

## Entity-Evidence Matrix

Added to `PRIORITIZATION_ROADMAP.md`:

| Entity | Evidence 1 | Evidence 2 | Evidence 3 | Overlap With |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| Phantom | EMF_SIGNATURE | PRISM_READING | VISUAL_MANIFESTATION | Wraith |
| Wraith | EMF_SIGNATURE | PRISM_READING | AURA_PATTERN | Phantom |
| Shade | EMF_SIGNATURE | GHOST_WRITING | FREEZING_TEMPERATURE | Revenant |
| Banshee | AURA_PATTERN | VISUAL_MANIFESTATION | HUNT_BEHAVIOR | Goryo |
| Revenant | FREEZING_TEMPERATURE | GHOST_WRITING | HUNT_BEHAVIOR | Shade |
| Poltergeist | PHYSICAL_INTERACTION | PRISM_READING | GHOST_WRITING | Mare |
| Mare | PRISM_READING | AURA_PATTERN | GHOST_WRITING | Poltergeist |
| Demon | FREEZING_TEMPERATURE | PHYSICAL_INTERACTION | AURA_PATTERN | Listener |
| Listener | FREEZING_TEMPERATURE | GHOST_WRITING | AURA_PATTERN | Demon |
| Goryo | AURA_PATTERN | VISUAL_MANIFESTATION | EMF_SIGNATURE | Banshee |

## Current State

- FW-044 (Phantom) is in `dev_in_progress` with corrected evidence types
- Entity tickets now aligned with implemented evidence system
- Ready to implement Phantom entity class

## Next Steps

1. **Implement FW-044 (Phantom)** - Create Phantom entity class with:
   - Evidence: EMF_SIGNATURE, PRISM_READING, VISUAL_MANIFESTATION
   - Behavioral tell: Disappears when photographed
   - Unique behavior: Looking at Phantom drops sanity faster

2. **FW-103 (draft)** - Clean up stale equipment constants in code when convenient

## Open Questions

None - evidence alignment complete.
