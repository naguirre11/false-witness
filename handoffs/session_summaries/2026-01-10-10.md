## Summary

Implemented FW-040a (Manifestation Evidence Capture) - connected entity manifestation events to the evidence system. When an entity manifests and players witness it, VISUAL_MANIFESTATION evidence is now automatically generated with witness tracking.

## Changes Made

- `src/entity/entity.gd`:
  - Added `manifestation_witnessed` signal
  - Added witness tracking during manifestation (range: 15m, line-of-sight check)
  - Modified `start_manifestation()` and `end_manifestation()` to track/emit witnesses
  - Added `_has_line_of_sight_to()` helper method

- `src/entity/entity_manager.gd`:
  - Connected `manifestation_witnessed` signal when spawning entities
  - Added evidence generation handler with quality logic (multi-witness = STRONG)

- `tests/test_entity.gd`: Added 10 new manifestation witness tracking tests
- `tests/test_entity_manager.gd`: Added 4 new manifestation evidence tests

- `tickets/`: Created FW-040a, FW-040b, FW-040c sub-tickets from oversized FW-040

## Current State

- FW-040a completed and moved to for_review
- FW-046 (Listener entity) remains BLOCKED by FW-014 (Voice Chat)
- NEXT ticket set to FW-091 (Audio Foundation)
- All 43 test files pass

## Next Steps

1. Work on FW-091 (Audio Foundation) - unblocked, high priority
2. Or FW-040b (Physical Interaction Framework) if continuing evidence system work
3. Parent ticket FW-040 is now an epic with three sub-tickets

## Open Questions / Decisions Needed

None - implementation complete and tested.
