## Summary

Implemented entity audio system (FW-092) with a dedicated EntityAudioManager autoload. The system provides hunt audio, ambient proximity sounds, manifestation audio, audio occlusion, dynamic mixing based on aggression, and silence horror cues. Integrated with Phantom entity as first implementation.

## Changes Made

### New Files
- `src/core/audio/entity_audio_config.gd` - Resource class for entity-specific audio configuration
- `src/core/audio/entity_audio_manager.gd` - Autoload managing all entity audio (~670 lines)
- `tests/integration/test_entity_audio_manager.gd` - 30 tests for the audio system

### Modified Files
- `src/entity/phantom.gd` - Added `@export var audio_config: EntityAudioConfig` and `_setup_audio()` method
- `project.godot` - Added EntityAudioManager autoload after AudioManager

## Current State

- All 8 acceptance criteria met for FW-092
- Full test suite: 1730 tests (1728 passing, 2 pending)
- Lint and format checks pass
- Ticket moved to `for_review/`

## Architecture Decisions

1. **Dedicated EntityAudioManager** - Follows FootstepManager pattern with EventBus integration
2. **EntityAudioConfig Resource** - Each entity type can have unique audio configuration
3. **Silence Horror Cue** - Fades ambient bus during hunt warning phase

## Key Integration Points

- EventBus signals: `hunt_warning_started`, `hunt_started`, `hunt_ended`, `entity_manifesting`, `entity_aggression_changed`, `entity_tell_triggered`, `player_died`
- Entity integration via `set_entity(entity, config)` API
- Player camera integration via `set_player_camera(camera)` for occlusion

## Next Steps

1. Pick next ticket from STATUS.md (needs NEXT pointer update)
2. Consider adding actual audio files to `assets/audio/entity/` for playtesting
3. Create EntityAudioConfig resources for each entity type as entities are implemented

## Open Questions / Decisions Needed

None - implementation complete and tested.
