## Summary

Implemented Thermometer equipment (FW-033) following the EMF Reader pattern. Created the core temperature detection system with TemperatureZone for room-based temperatures and Thermometer equipment for detecting freezing conditions. Visual effects (breath, frost) deferred to FW-040.

## Changes Made

- `src/equipment/temperature_zone.gd`: TemperatureZone class - Node3D added to "temperature_zone" group, provides base temperature with entity influence and natural variance
- `src/equipment/thermometer.gd`: Thermometer equipment extending Equipment base class with FREEZING_TEMPERATURE evidence collection
- `src/core/managers/event_bus.gd`: Added 6 new signals (3 for EMF formalization, 3 for Thermometer)
- `tests/test_temperature_zone.gd`: 29 unit tests for TemperatureZone
- `tests/test_thermometer.gd`: 33 unit tests for Thermometer

## Current State

- All 646 tests passing (62 new for thermometer)
- Core temperature detection functional
- Evidence collection integrates with EvidenceManager
- Network sync prepared via EventBus signals
- Visual effects (breath below 3°C, frost below -5°C) deferred to FW-040 (Readily-Apparent Evidence)

## Next Steps

1. Pick next ticket from ready/ (FW-037 Spectral Prism Rig or another evidence equipment)
2. FW-040 should eventually implement breath/frost visual effects using thermometer's is_freezing()/is_extreme_cold() methods
3. Entity AI (FW-041) will call zone.entity_enter() when entity enters a room

## Open Questions / Decisions Needed

None - implementation followed established EMF Reader patterns.
