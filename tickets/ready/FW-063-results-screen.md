## Description

Create the results screen shown after each match. Critical for learning and social engagement - shows what really happened.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Correct entity revealed with its evidence types
- [ ] Cultist identity revealed
- [ ] Timeline of Cultist actions (what they contaminated)
- [ ] Which evidence was real vs contaminated
- [ ] Individual contribution breakdown (evidence collected)
- [ ] Win/loss status with reason
- [ ] Humorous superlatives ("Most Screams", "Best Hide", etc.)
- [ ] Return to lobby button

## Technical Notes

Per GDD: "Post-game breakdown shows Cultist's moves, enabling learning."

This screen is important for player retention - understanding what happened makes players want to play again.

## Out of Scope

- XP/progression display
- Statistics tracking
- Replay system
