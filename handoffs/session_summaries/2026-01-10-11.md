## Summary

Implemented FW-091 (Audio System Foundation) - created the core audio infrastructure including AudioManager autoload, audio bus configuration, sound pooling, and footstep system with surface-based variation.

## Changes Made

- `default_bus_layout.tres`: Created audio bus structure (Master, SFX, Music, Voice, Ambient)
- `project.godot`: Added AudioManager autoload and audio bus resource path
- `src/core/audio_manager.gd`: Created AudioManager autoload with volume controls, sound pooling, and spatial audio presets
- `src/core/audio/surface_audio.gd`: Created SurfaceAudio resource class for surface-based footstep configuration
- `src/core/audio/footstep_manager.gd`: Created FootstepManager component for detecting surfaces and playing footsteps
- `scenes/player/player.tscn`: Added FootstepManager node and connected footstep signal
- `tests/test_audio_manager.gd`: 33 tests for AudioManager functionality
- `tests/test_surface_audio.gd`: 21 tests for SurfaceAudio resource
- `tests/test_footstep_manager.gd`: 16 tests for FootstepManager

## Current State

Audio foundation is complete. The system provides:
- 5 audio buses with volume controls
- Sound pooling for frequently played sounds
- One-shot 2D and 3D spatial sounds with auto-cleanup
- Three spatial audio presets (close, medium, long range)
- Footstep system that detects surface types via metadata on colliders
- 9 surface types with configurable volume offsets and pitch variation

All 1683 tests pass.

## Next Steps

- FW-092-entity-audio: Entity-specific audio (hunt sounds, footsteps, vocalizations)
- Actual footstep audio assets need to be added to `assets/audio/` and configured via SurfaceAudio resources
- Surface types need to be set on level geometry using the `surface_type` metadata

## Open Questions / Decisions Needed

None - implementation matches ticket requirements.
