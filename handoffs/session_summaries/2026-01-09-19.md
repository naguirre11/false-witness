## Summary

Implemented the Aura Imager Unit (FW-038c), the "secret operator" equipment for the Aura detection system. Created the complete AuraImager class with state machine, spatial positioning validation, aura resolution based on alignment quality, evidence collection, and third-party observation mechanics for counter-play.

## Changes Made

- `src/equipment/aura/aura_imager.gd`: AuraImager class extending CooperativeEquipment
  - ImagerState enum: IDLE, POSITIONING, DIRECTING, VIEWING, RECORDING
  - DirectionCommand enum for social voice commands
  - ReadingQuality enum: NONE, WEAK, STRONG
  - Resolution system with thresholds (0.3 color, 0.5 form, 0.7 full)
  - Spatial positioning validation using SpatialConstraints from FW-038a
  - Automatic connection to Dowser signals (alignment_achieved, alignment_lost, hold_steady_started)
  - Evidence creation with both collector IDs (cooperative evidence)
  - Third-party observation via `can_observer_see_screen()` - validates distance and viewing angle
  - Observable state intentionally excludes screen content (enforces asymmetric trust)

- `tests/test_aura_imager.gd`: 64 comprehensive tests covering all acceptance criteria

## Current State

FW-038c is complete and moved to for_review. All 64 tests pass. The Aura Imager completes the FW-038 epic (Dowsing Rods + Aura Imager cooperative equipment).

Key design notes:
1. **Toggle mode equipment** - Call use() to activate, use() again to deactivate
2. **Partner required** - Cannot activate without Dowser partner (unlike Dowser which can SEEK alone)
3. **Asymmetric trust** - Only Imager sees screen content. Observable state excludes color/form/resolution.
4. **Cultist deception** - Purely social, no gameplay enforcement. Imager can lie about what they see.

## Next Steps

1. **FW-039: Ghost Writing Book** (marked as NEXT)
   - Triggered test evidence type
   - Player places book, entity writes if criteria met
   - Different mechanic from cooperative equipment

## Open Questions / Decisions Needed

None - implementation follows patterns from FW-037 (Spectral Prism) and FW-038a/b.
