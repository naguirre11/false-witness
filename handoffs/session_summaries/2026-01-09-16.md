## Summary

Implemented the Spectral Prism Lens Reader Unit (FW-037c), the second-stage equipment piece for cooperative two-player evidence gathering. The Lens Reader receives calibration data from the partner Calibrator and displays the combined entity signature (shape + color) for evidence collection.

## Changes Made

- `src/equipment/spectral_prism/lens_reader.gd`: New SpectralPrismLensReader class
  - ReaderState enum (IDLE, WAITING, VIEWING, READING)
  - `on_calibration_locked()` callback from partner Calibrator
  - Pattern/color display via `get_pattern_shape()`, `get_pattern_color()`
  - `get_combined_signature()` and `is_consistent()` for verification
  - Evidence collection via `start_reading()` with quality assessment
  - Quality factors: alignment, movement, viewing time
  - Network state sync support

- `tests/test_lens_reader.gd`: 57 comprehensive tests
  - Activation rules and calibration callback
  - Eyepiece display and pattern reading
  - Quality assessment factors
  - Evidence collection flow
  - Network state serialization

## Current State

FW-037c is complete and moved to for_review. All acceptance criteria are met except visual effects (deferred - requires shader work). The Spectral Prism Rig epic (FW-037) is now functionally complete with both Calibrator and Lens Reader implemented.

All tests passing (57/57 for lens reader, 971/971 full suite).

## Next Steps

- FW-038 (Dowsing Rods + Aura Imager) - the asymmetric cooperative equipment
- This uses VARIABLE trust (one party sees more than the other)

## Open Questions / Decisions Needed

None - implementation follows the ticket specifications.
