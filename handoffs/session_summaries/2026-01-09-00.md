## Summary

Implemented collector attribution and verification state visualization for the evidence board (FW-035c). Each evidence slot now shows who collected it, verification status with distinct icons/colors, and detailed tooltips with timestamp and location.

## Changes Made

- `src/ui/evidence_slot.gd`: Added verification icon display, collector attribution row with colored player indicators, enhanced tooltips showing collection details
- `src/ui/evidence_board.gd`: Updated to pass Evidence objects to slots, connected to verification_changed signal
- `scenes/ui/evidence_slot.tscn`: Added VerificationIcon label and CollectorRow container, increased slot height from 80 to 100
- `tests/test_evidence_slot.gd`: Added 20 new tests for FW-035c functionality

## Current State

FW-035c is complete and moved to for_review. All 45 evidence slot tests and 20 evidence board tests pass. The evidence board now shows:
- Verification state: Gray checkmark (unverified), green double-check (verified), orange warning (contested)
- Collector indicators: Colored circles with player initials (P0-P9)
- Enhanced tooltips: Trust level, verification status, collector names, timestamp (MM:SS), location coordinates

## Next Steps

1. Next ticket: FW-036 (Cross-verification system)
2. Dependencies satisfied: FW-031 (evidence core), FW-035 (evidence board)
3. This ticket builds the logic for verifying/contesting evidence via player interactions

## Open Questions / Decisions Needed

None. Implementation complete per acceptance criteria.
