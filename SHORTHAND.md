# SHORTHAND

These are commonly used text blocks, similar to % commands, but are used to simply reduce user typing input, triggered by the "^" symbol. Main difference between COMMANDS is that these can appear within prompts, as opposed to standalone.

## ^future/ ^f

   "Do this to enable future Claude instances to have sufficient understanding of the problem/solution."

   This is used to indicate that, while your running context might have sufficient understanding now, we need to ensure all future claude instances also have this information available. Typically this will involve updating CLAUDE.md or a similar .md file.

## ^wrong / ^w

   Shorthand for something has gone wrong in your implementation. Typically, this may be a case where a workaround or hack was used to force a successful test. Or you're attempting to use an approach that is off-limits.

   Investigate what happened. The user may choose to provide more context after the command.

   If unclear, request further details from user.
